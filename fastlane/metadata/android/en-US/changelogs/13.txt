v1.3.3+13
- Downloads: backend now waits for the full file before returning so "Download complete" and the saved file are in sync.
- Downloads: larger transfer buffer and throttled progress updates for faster, smoother downloads.
- Downloads: clearer toasts—"Downloading" on tap, "Download complete" only when the file is fully written; "Download failed" when the backend returns an error.
- Update UI: Added Quick Access Section in Library
